# BERT for Sentiment Analysis: A Beginner's Guide 🚀

Welcome to our project on leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis! This project is perfect for beginners who are diving into the exciting world of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. 🤖

## Introduction 📖

This project focuses on using BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, for classifying sentiments in text data. Sentiment analysis is a common task in NLP where the goal is to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in text. We use the `ktrain` library, a lightweight wrapper for `tensorflow` and `keras`, to simplify the process.

## Installation 🛠

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone [repository-link]`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python packages.

3. **Install `ktrain`:**  
   `ktrain` is a key library for this project. Install it using:  
   `pip install ktrain`

## Usage 🖥

- Open the `BERT_ForSA_Beginner.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook. Each cell is well-documented to guide you through the process.
- The notebook covers everything from data preprocessing to training and evaluating the BERT model.

## Acknowledgements and Resources 📚

This project was inspired by and built upon the concepts taught in the [Natural Language Processing with BERT](https://www.udemy.com/course/natural-language-processing-with-bert/) course on Udemy. A huge thanks to the course creators for providing such an in-depth and practical approach to learning BERT and NLP.
